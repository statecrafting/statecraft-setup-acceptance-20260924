# The aggregate gate. It passes only when every job the TRUSTED policy names
# as required ended the way its event requires:
#
#   required          must be `success`; `skipped` is an unexpected skip
#   required-review   `success` carrying a review result (findings,
#                     no-findings, or a visible skipped:<class>)
#   rc-exception      required (success) for a release candidate whose review
#                     was skipped; otherwise inapplicable
#   inapplicable      must be `skipped`, and the rule that admitted it is printed
#
# A required job missing from the needs record has vanished, and blocks. The
# required set is read from the policy at the base commit, never from the
# candidate, so a candidate cannot drop a job from the set that judges it.
#
# Inputs, all from the environment: NEEDS_JSON (toJSON(needs)), EVENT_NAME,
# HEAD_SHA, BASE_SHA (the pull request base, or the push's previous head),
# HEAD_REF (the pull request head ref; empty on push).
